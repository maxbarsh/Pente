# Pente
This program is a recreation of  of the classic strategy game, Pente.  The application contains a simple GUI for playing the game as well as full documentation for the rules of the game.  The GUI has a status bar at the bottom that displays when a player scores a tria (three in a row) or tessera (four in a row).  It also keeps track of the number of captures for both players.
 
 The program also contains some fun hidden dragons...
